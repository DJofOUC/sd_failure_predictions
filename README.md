## Hard drive failure prediction based on S.M.A.R.T. attributes

### Main goal of the research

The purpose of this repository is:

1. To reproduce results from articles on the same dataset

2. To compare results. Create pivot tables

3. To create the most accurate model

### Dataset

At the time of the research there was data from BackBlaze up to 2018 year.
Lets take data from 2015 to 2018 year. Test data is data from 4th quarter of 2018 year.

### Metrics

Main metrics are FAR and FDR. These metrics are very popular in hard drive prediction applications.

### Articles analysis

7. Predicting Disk Replacement towards Reliable Data Centers
